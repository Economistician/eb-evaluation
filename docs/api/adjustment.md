# Adjustment API

This section documents **evaluation-time adjustment utilities** provided by
**eb-evaluation**, which apply deterministic transformations to forecast outputs
prior to evaluation.

Adjustment utilities operate on explicitly supplied parameters or policies and
do not perform learning or calibration.

All content below is generated automatically from NumPy-style docstrings
